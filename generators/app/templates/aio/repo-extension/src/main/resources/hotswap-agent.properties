# Add a directory prior to webapp path (load webapp resources).

#
# Similar to extraClasspath this property adds classpath when searching for resources (not classes).
# While extra classpath just modifies the classloader, this setting does nothing until the resource
# is really changed.
#
# Sometimes it is not possible to point extraClasspath to your i.e. src/main/resources, because there are multiple
# replacements of resources in a building step (maven filtering resource option).
# This setting will leave i.e. src/target/classes as default source for resources, but after the resource is modified
# in src/main/resources, the new changed resource is served instead.
